High:
* Switching quickly between navigation item causes loop. 2 quick backs.

* Compile a list of things that should be easy to do and implement them. Button activation cancelled by vertical scrolling but not horizontal, Pinch to zoom, Highlighting a view and dragging outside of it and back in., Horizontal swipe on tableview to show delete button, Touch driven animations. AKA swipe back to navigate.
